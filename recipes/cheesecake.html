        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This butternut squash cheesecake is geniusâ€”it's lighter, more flavorful, and just
            <br>as rich and decadent as its pumpkin cheesecake cousin. This one is baked
            <br>Basque cheesecake-style, hot and fast, needs no crust, and will be nicely
            <br>browned on top. It may crack, but really, do we care when it is this creamy and
            <br>delicious?</p>
        <div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large butternut squash, roasted to yield 1 1/2 cups mashed squash</li>
            <li>16 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Oil a 10-inch
                <br>springform pan, line with parchment, and set aside. Line a
                <br>baking sheet with parchment.</li>
            <li>Cut butternut squash into thick crosswise slices, remove seeds,
                <br>and place on the lined baking sheet. </li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until very soft, about 1 hour. When
                <br>cool enough to handle, separate the flesh from the skin; discard
                <br>skin. Mash squash until smooth, measure out 1 1/2 cups, and set
                <br>aside to cool completely. Reserve any remaining squash for
                <br>another use.</li>
            <li>Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Add softened cream cheese, sugar, flour, and salt to a bowl, and
                <br>cream together with a spatula until very smooth. </li>
            <li>Add maple syrup, 1 1/2 cups mashed butternut squash,
                <br>cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Mix with an electric mixer or
                <br>whisk until combined; mix in vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time,
                <br>beating well after each addition. Stir in cream.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared springform pan. Tap the pan lightly on
                <br>the counter to settle the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is almost fully set,
                <br>50 to 60 minutes. The center should wiggle very slightly If the
                <br>pan is shaken back and forth. If the center seems soupy,
                <br>continue baking for a few more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and let cool for 5 minutes. Run a thin knife between the
                <br>outside edge of the cheesecake and the inside of the springform
                <br>ring to release cheesecake from the ring; it will contract as it
                <br>cools. Let cool 30 minutes more, then remove outside ring.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate cheesecake for a few hours or up to overnight before
                <br>serving.</li>

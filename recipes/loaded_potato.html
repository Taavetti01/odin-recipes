        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This loaded sweet potato casserole is not only gorgeous, it has the perfect
            <br>texture, and is absolutely the most delicious sweet potato casserole ever. With
            <br>bacon, sharp Cheddar cheese, tangy sour cream, and green onions, it has
            <br>everything you'd ever load onto a potato, but is made with nutritious, vibrant
            <br>orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (3 1/2 to 4 pounds)</li>
            <li>1 pound thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>3/4 cup green onions, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>6 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
                <br>Place sweet potatoes on the baking sheet and prick all over with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour.
                <br>Let sit until cool enough to handle. Do not turn off the oven.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a cold pan over medium-high heat, and cook until fat begins to
                <br>render; stir and reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally,
                <br>until the fat is fully rendered out and bacon is browned and fully cooked. Drain
                <br>off bacon fat, and reserve for another use. </li>
            <li>Scoop sweet potatoes into a mixing bowl, discarding the skin. Use a spoon to
                <br>break the chunks of sweet potato into smaller, more uniform pieces. The texture
                <br>can be as smooth or coarse as you like.</li>
            <li>Add the salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, egg, sour cream, green onions, half
                <br>of reserved bacon, and two-thirds of cheese. Stir together until everything is
                <br>evenly mixed. </li>
            <li>Distribute mixture evenly into a shallow 2-quart baking dish, but leave the
                <br>surface roughly textured. Scatter on the remaining bacon, followed by
                <br>remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake casserole in the preheated oven until the top is browned, and the
                <br>casserole is heated through and bubbling around the edges, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with more sliced green onions and sour cream if desired.</li>

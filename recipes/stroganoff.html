        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This classic beef stroganoff recipe is a fairly lean version, as most recipes call for more cream.
            This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes. I like a little thicker version,
            with just enough sauce to coat the meat. Serve over buttered noodles.</p>
